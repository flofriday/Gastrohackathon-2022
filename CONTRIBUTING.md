# Contributing
We welcome any and all contributions. 
For now it is not necessary to create an issue first and you can just open up a new PR with features. 
However we expect you to have read open and closed issues on related topics.

## Commit messages
The first line of a commit message is the header written in present-tense.
Headers also start with an emoji depending on its content:

- :art: `:art:` for improving the code
- :tada: `:tada:` for adding features
- :bug: `:bug:`for fixing bugs
- :racehorse: `:racehorse:` for improving performance
