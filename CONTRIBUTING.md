# Contributing
We welcome all contributions, you are awsome ðŸ˜Š.

For now it is not necessary to create an issue first and you can just open up a PR with new features. 
However, we expect you to have read open and closed issues on related topics.

## Commit messages
The first line of a commit message is the header written in present-tense.
Headers also start with an emoji depending on its content:

- :art: `:art:` for improving the code
- :tada: `:tada:` for adding features
- :bug: `:bug:`for fixing bugs
- :racehorse: `:racehorse:` for improving performance

In the lines below that you can optionally describe in more detail what your
code changes and why that is an improvement.

Here is an excellent example of a commit message:

```
:tada: Add cuisine to a cook profile

It is now easier to detect if a cook fits your needs by taking a quick look
at the cuisine they are best known for.
```

## Code styles
- For python we use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format the code.
- For Javascript and web we use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code.
